For any positive integer n,
define μ(n):
  define μ(n)μ(n) as the sum of the primitive n^\text{th}n th
  roots of unity.
  roots of unity.

### It has values in \{-1, 0, 1\}{−1,0,1} depending on the factorization of nn into prime factors:

### - μ(n) = 1  μ(n)=1 if nn is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.
### - μ(n) = -1 μ(n)=−1 if nn is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.
### - μ(n) = 0  μ(n)=0 if nn has a squared prime factor.
